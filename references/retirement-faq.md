## Basic, Standard, and Premium Tiers

### What is retiring?
All instances of Azure Cache for Redis (Basic, Standard, and Premium tiers) will be retired on **September 30, 2028**.

### What happens to existing instances?
- Instances remain available until September 30, 2028
- Regular maintenance continues to keep instances secure and stable
- Starting October 1, 2028, all remaining instances will be **disabled**

### Why upgrade to Azure Managed Redis?
- Greater performance and more cost-effective
- Enterprise features: active geo-replication, Redis modules
- Zone redundant by default
- Built for Microsoft Entra ID authentication (more secure than access keys)

### Application changes required
- Update Redis hostname and access key to new AMR instance
- AMR instances are **clustered by default** - configure client library accordingly
- Most client libraries (like StackExchange.Redis) work without special configuration
- Non-clustered option available up to 25GB (clustering recommended for better performance)
- Check for [cross-slot commands](https://redis.io/blog/redis-clustering-best-practices-with-keys/) compatibility

### Reservations
- Existing reservations supported until September 30, 2028
- Can cancel or exchange reservations before that date

## Enterprise and Enterprise Flash Tiers

### What is retiring?
All instances of Azure Cache for Redis Enterprise and Enterprise Flash tiers will be retired on **March 31, 2027**.

### Why upgrade Enterprise to AMR?
- Better performance and more cost-effective
- Azure first-party offering (no Marketplace component)
- Eliminates quorum node (reduces overhead and costs)
- Available in more Azure regions
- Zone redundant by default
- Non-HA options for dev/test at reduced cost
- Simplified SKU structure based on memory/performance
- Microsoft Entra ID authentication built-in

### Reservations
- Existing reservations supported until March 30, 2027
