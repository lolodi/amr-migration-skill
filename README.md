# AMR Migration Skill

An [Open Agent Skill](https://agentskills.io) to help users migrate from Azure Cache for Redis to Azure Managed Redis (AMR).

## Overview

This skill assists AI agents in helping users:
- Compare features between Azure Cache for Redis and Azure Managed Redis
- Select appropriate AMR SKUs based on existing ACR cache configurations
- Plan and execute migrations with best practices
- Troubleshoot common migration issues

## Usage

Load this skill into your AI agent (GitHub Copilot, Claude, etc.) to get assistance with Azure Redis migration tasks.

### With GitHub Copilot

```
# Reference this skill in your copilot configuration
```

### With Claude Code

```
# Add to your agent skills directory
```

## Example Prompts

Try these prompts to get started:

- **"I need to migrate my Azure Cache for Redis to AMR"** — starts a guided migration workflow
- **"What AMR SKU should I use for my P2 cache with 3 shards?"** — gets a SKU recommendation
- **"Compare pricing between my current P2 and AMR M20 in westus2"** — runs the pricing scripts
- **"Pull metrics for my cache `my-redis` in resource group `my-rg`"** — fetches Server Load, memory, ops/sec
- **"What are the connection string differences between ACR and AMR?"** — highlights port/DNS changes
- **"When is Azure Cache for Redis being retired?"** — retirement dates and timeline
